# Avatar Maker

## Idea and resources

From the repo [Avatar Maker](https://github.com/favrora/Avatar-Maker), I finally found out how the fashion or cartoon avatar mini-games works. I played them when I was a child. I use the idea and resources from that repo to create my own.

My repo is just a simple React app which reproduce the original repo.

## Tasks
